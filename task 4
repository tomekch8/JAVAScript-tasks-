We have created a program that collects statistics webinars, and recently we decided to improve it. Namely: in its latest version, the program sends data to the server in the form of the sequence 111001010111011, where 1 symbolizes students who have understood the topic, and 0 represents students who need a repetition. With the next update, we would like the program to automatically count the number of students in category 1 and those in category 0.
Prepare a getSuccessRate function that accepts a statistic string and returns the percentage of students who understood the material. If the output string is empty, return the number 0.

function getSuccessRate(statistic) { 
  if (statistic.length === 0) { return 0; } 
let pass = 0;
let again = 0;
for (let digit of statistic) {
    if (digit === '1') {
        pass++;
    }
    if (digit === '0') {
        again++;
    }
}
return (pass / (pass + again)) * 100 
}
