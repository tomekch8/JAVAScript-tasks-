// Write a getLocation function that takes two parameters:
//coordinates - matrix of initial coordinates in two axes [x, y];
//commands - matrix with command history ['command1', 'command2', 'command3' ...].
//The function should return a matrix with the final coordinates ([x, y]) where the robot should be located after performing movements in accordance with the commands instructions.
//code example: getLocation([0, 0], ['forward', 'right']); // [1, 1]

function getLocation(coordinates, commands) {
