Let's say bank allows you to deposit into an interest-bearing savings account. For example, if you entrust them with PLN 10,000 for three years at an interest rate of 4 percentage points, you will receive:

10000 + 4% = 10400 (10000 + 10000 * 0.04) - in the first year;
10400 + 4% = 10816 (10400 + 10400 * 0.04) - in the second year;
10816 + 4% = 11248.64 (10816 + 10816 * 0.04) - in the third year;
11248.64 - 10000 = 1248.64 net profit.
Create a calculateProfit function that takes three parameters:

amount - the amount you would like to deposit at the start;
percent - annual interest rate of the account;
period - the number of years (during which the money will remain in the account).
The function should calculate and return the net profit for the life of the deposit.

function calculateProfit(amount, percent, period) {
  let total = amount;
  for (let i = 1; i <= period; i++) {
    total += total * (percent / 100);
  }
  let profit= total - amount
  return profit ;
}
