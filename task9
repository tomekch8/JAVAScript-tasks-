Create a getPlan function that takes three parameters:

startProduction - planned production scale (number) of robots per month;
numberOfMonths - the number of months during which we plan to increase production;
percent - expected month-to-month production growth expressed as a percentage.
The function should return an array with targets for a specific numberOfMonth.

To understand how the function is supposed to work, let's use an example. Let's assume we have startProduction = 200, numberOfMonths = 3, and percent = 50:

the first goal is to produce 200 + 50% = 300 robots;
the second goal is to produce 300 + 50% = 450 robots;
and the third is the production of 450 + 50% = 675 robots.
As a result, we will get an array [300, 450, 675].

function getPlan(startProduction, numberOfMonths, percent) {
  let goalsArray=[]
  let currentProduction=startProduction
  let m=0
for (let i=0; i<numberOfMonths ; i++ ) {
 m =Math.floor(currentProduction+currentProduction*percent/100);

goalsArray.push(m)

currentProduction=m ;}

return goalsArray;
}
